I have figured out a way to use `WriteTeX` in Mac OSX without `fink` installed. I upload a version of pstoedit for Mac OSX binary into the repository of `WriteTeX`, which is depending on [Inkscape of this version]({% post_url 2014-11-04-InksacapeNative %}) installed in default location (Drag the app into your `Applications` folder). If you have no problem with this settings and you have the administrator privilege, then here is a solution for you.

1. Download the binary from [https://github.com/wanglongqi/WriteTeX/raw/master/pstoedit.zip]
