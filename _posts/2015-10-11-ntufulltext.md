This is a extreme simple plug-in for Opera and Chrome. Although this is equivalent to a Bookmarklet in the bookmarks bar, I do not like to have a bookmark in the bar. Actually most of time I do not use bookmarks bar at all. For more detail, please check [the project page](https://github.com/NDT-Lab/NTUFullText).
